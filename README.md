# etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a web-based drawing application that allows you to create colorful drawings by hovering or clicking on a grid of squares. It includes various features such as rainbow mode for random colors, a hover-click switch, a new button for customizing the grid size, and a range feature for adjusting the size of each square. Additionally, there are plans to implement a darker mode that gradually applies lesser transparency to colors until they become black. The user interface (UI) is being improved to enhance the overall user experience.

# Features
Rainbow Mode: Enables the drawing of random colors on the grid, providing a vibrant and dynamic drawing experience.

Hover-Click Switch: Allows you to choose between hover painting and continuous painting while clicking. The switch provides flexibility in your drawing style.

Custom Grid Size: The "New" button prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 100, specifying the desired size of the grid. This allows for creating grids of different sizes to suit your drawing needs.

Range Feature: A range input control allows you to adjust the size of each square in the grid. The range spans from 1 to 100, providing versatility in the grid's visual representation.

Darker Mode (Upcoming): A darker mode is currently under development, which will gradually reduce the transparency of colors applied to the grid until they reach a black shade. This mode aims to provide a different aesthetic and expand the creative possibilities.

# Usage
To use the Etch-a-Sketch application:

Open the web page hosting the Etch-a-Sketch application in a web browser.

Move your cursor over the grid squares to start drawing. If the hover-click switch is enabled, clicking and holding the mouse button will enable continuous painting.

Toggle the rainbow mode switch to enable or disable random colors while drawing.

Adjust the range input control to change the size of each square in the grid.

Click the "New" button to prompt a dialog box where you can enter a number between 1 and 100 to create a new grid of the desired size.

Explore and experiment with the different features to create your own unique drawings!
